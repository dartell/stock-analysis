# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	The purpose of this analysis was to create a macros in VBA to help analysze stocks. 

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2018 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

	The refractored script ran faster than the original script.  Comparing 2018 to 2018 led to the same result.  I instead compared 2017 to 2018 execution times

  Both times were identical.
  
  I also compared the 2017 stock performance to 2018:

   2018 was a down year compared to 2017.  2017 had great returns
  

### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
	Ractoring code allows you to improve upon an existing product.  You can make it faster and run better than the previous iteration.  The disadvantage is that you could lose the initial scope of the project, make it worse, or have a hard time understanding the purpose to fix bugs if you mess up or don't have a frame of reference.
	

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
	They allow the user to improve the macros.  Making them run faster and add different functionality.  You can also make the script run worse if you don't properly refractor.
